Description

Palander is a software framework that lets a Blender user pass scene information to a separate simulation 
engine, which is able to run in highly distributed form on a supercomputer. The engine used in this version 
is Palabos, a parallel Lattice Boltzmann solver. Palander, Blender, and Palabos are all open-source software.
